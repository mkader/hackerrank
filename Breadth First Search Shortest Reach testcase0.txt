Explanation

We perform the following two queries:

The given graph can be represented as: 
start
1------->2     4
|
|
v
3

where our start node, 2, is node . The shortest distances from s to the other nodes are one edge to node 2, one edge to node 3, and an infinite distance to node  4(which it's not connected to). We then print 1 node 's distance to nodes 2, 3, and  4(respectively) as a single line of space-separated integers: 6, 6, -1.

The given graph can be represented as: 
graph2
start
2------>3    1
where our start node,s , is node 2. There is only one edge here, so node 2 is unreachable from node 2 and node 3 has one edge connecting it to node 2. We then print node 2's distance to nodes 1 and  3(respectively) as a single line of space-separated integers: -1 6.

Note: Recall that the actual length of each edge is 6, and we print -1 as the distance to any node that's unreachable from s.
